# Agentic AI for Maritime Freight Pricing & Route Optimization

### Codename: FreightQuote AI

**Infosys Springboard Internship — Overall Project README (Milestones 1–4)**

FreightQuote AI is a maritime freight decision-support application that combines multiple AI agents, machine-learning models, document retrieval, route analysis, pricing tools, and an AI Copilot in one Streamlit-based platform.

This is the **single overall README** for the project — it covers everything built across all four milestones, from the first login screen to the final 9-agent integrated platform. Individual milestones aren't kept as separate READMEs; each one is summarized below and then folded into the full documentation that follows.

> 💡 **In simple terms:** think of FreightQuote AI as one dashboard that replaces several spreadsheets and manual lookups a freight broker would normally juggle — pricing a shipment, checking if a carrier is reliable, seeing if a storm will delay a port, and asking a chatbot for answers instead of digging through documents.

## 🧭 Project Evolution — What Each Milestone Added

The platform was built incrementally. Each milestone added a working layer on top of the last, and the final app (documented in full below) is the sum of all four.

| Milestone | Focus | What Was Delivered |
|---|---|---|
| **Milestone 1** | Authentication & Access | Secure sign-in, account registration, and password recovery via Security Question **or** Email OTP (6-digit, time-limited). Formed the entry point for every later milestone. |
| **Milestone 2** | Core Platform & First Agents | The first working version of the freight platform: Customer & Admin dashboards, and the first 3 AI agents — **Freight Pricing**, **Route/Weather Risk**, and **Carrier Audit** — plus an early AI Copilot. |
| **Milestone 3** | RAG Knowledge Center | Added a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline: 50+ generated logistics SOP/customs/insurance PDFs, chunked and indexed in FAISS, searchable through a dedicated semantic-search dashboard with source-cited answers. |
| **Milestone 4** | Full Integration | Everything above was merged into **one connected application**, expanded from 3 agents to **9 specialised agents**, added role-based access control (RBAC) with 5 roles, a full Admin Dashboard, Knowledge Graph, Digital Twin simulation, Anomaly Scanner, Notifications, and multilingual support. This is the current, complete state of the platform. |

Everything from this point on documents the **current, integrated Milestone 4 application** — which is what you'll actually run. Where relevant, notes call out which milestone introduced a given piece.

                 └──────────────────────────┘
```

### How a Copilot request is handled

1. The user's question is classified by the intent router.
2. Relevant information is retrieved from SQLite or a calculation tool.
3. If the answer requires a document, the RAG pipeline (built in Milestone 3) searches the indexed PDFs.
4. Retrieved information is passed to the local Qwen model.
5. The Copilot generates an answer based on the available context.
6. NLLB-200 can translate the response when required.

The design aims to keep the Copilot grounded in application data rather than generating unsupported freight values.

---

## 🔐 Milestone 1 — Authentication & Access

The foundation of the platform. Every later milestone builds on top of this login flow.

- **Signup** — username, email, password (strength-checked), and a security question/answer
- **Login** — session-based sign-in with JWT tokens
- **Forgot Password** — two independent recovery routes:
  - **Security Question route** — answer the previously-set question to reset directly
  - **OTP route** — a 6-digit, time-limited code emailed to the registered address
- **Account protection** — progressive lockout after repeated failed login attempts

### RBAC Roles (expanded in Milestone 4)

| Role | Main Access |
|---|---|
| Admin | Complete platform and administration features |
| Ops Manager / Freight Broker | Operational agents and AI Copilot |
| Dispatcher | Copilot and selected operational modules |
| Customer / Client | Copilot and quote-related features |

Authentication includes:

- Email and OTP login
- JWT-based sessions
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Security questions
- Progressive account lockout
- Role-based menu access

---

## 🚀 Milestone 2 — Core Platform & First 3 Agents

The first working version of the platform, built directly on top of the Milestone 1 login system. It introduced:

- **Customer Dashboard** — live fleet health index, active shipments, on-time rate, and daily quote count
- **Admin Control Panel** — manage registered users and view the ML Model Card
- **Agent 1 (early) – Freight Pricing** — predicted shipment cost from distance, cargo weight, congestion level, fuel index, cargo type, and port dwell time
- **Agent 2 (early) – Route & Weather Risk** — estimated delay risk between origin/destination ports
- **Agent 3 (early) – Carrier Audit & Tariff Compliance** — scored carrier compliance (punctuality, fuel efficiency, tariff adherence)
- **Early AI Copilot** — a first version of the chat assistant, later replaced by the fully grounded Copilot in Milestone 4

These three agents were later expanded into the 9-agent system documented below.

---

## 📚 Milestone 3 — RAG Knowledge Center

Turned the platform's static logistics documentation into a searchable, conversational knowledge base — this pipeline now powers **Agent 9: PDF RAG Studio** in the current app.

### How it works
1. **Knowledge Base Generation** — auto-generates 50+ unique logistics SOP/customs/insurance PDFs
2. **Ingestion Pipeline** — loads PDFs, skips corrupted documents gracefully, splits text with recursive chunking
3. **Embedding & Indexing** — encodes chunks with Sentence-Transformers, stores them in a persistent **FAISS** vector database
4. **Retrieval + Generation** — retrieves the most relevant chunks by similarity score and passes them to the LLM to generate a grounded, source-cited answer
5. **Automated Evaluation Suite** — runs targeted logistics questions and logs retrieval accuracy, similarity scores, and generation latency

---

## 🔗 Milestone 4 — Full Integration (Current State)

The major outcome of this milestone is the transition from separate project components to a **single integrated freight-intelligence platform**, expanding from 3 agents to 9 and adding the operational tooling (RBAC, Admin Dashboard, Knowledge Graph, Digital Twin, Anomaly Scanner, Notifications, translation) documented in the sections below.

### Key takeaways

- Multiple AI agents can work within one application.
- Operational data and ML predictions are presented together.
- The AI Copilot can use structured database information and retrieved documents.
- RBAC provides different views for different users.
- RAG extends the system beyond structured database queries.
- Route, pricing, weather, carrier and customs analysis can be accessed from one interface.
- Supporting tools such as anomaly detection, digital twin simulation and knowledge graphs provide additional operational insight.

## 🗃️ Data & Storage

SQLite acts as the main application database.

The database stores operational information such as:

- Ports
- Shipments
- Carriers
- Routes
- Freight quotes
- Customs requirements
- Weather-risk information
- Operational records
- ML metrics

Demo data can be generated or prepared through the project's data-seeding pipeline.

---

## 🔄 Execution Flow (Current App)

The recommended order for running the complete application is:

```text
Prepare Data
     ↓
Seed SQLite Database
     ↓
Prepare PDF / RAG Index
     ↓
Load Qwen + Translation Engines
     ↓
Start AI Agents
     ↓
Verify Authentication & RBAC
     ↓
Run End-to-End Tests
     ↓
Launch Streamlit
     ↓
Expose Application
```

This order reduces dependency issues because the Copilot and several agents require database and document-retrieval components to be ready first.

---

## 📖 Glossary (Simple Terms)

A few shipping terms used throughout this README, explained simply:

| Term | Simple Meaning |
|---|---|
| **BAF** | Bunker Adjustment Factor — an extra fee added to cover changing fuel prices |
| **TEU** | Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit — the standard way to measure how much a container can hold |
| **HS Code** | A code used worldwide to classify goods for customs purposes |
| **Dwell Time** | How long cargo sits at a port before it moves on |
| **Bill of Lading** | A shipping receipt/legal document showing what's being shipped and to whom |
| **RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation — the AI looks up real documents before answering, instead of guessing |
| **RBAC** | Role-Based Access Control — different users see different features depending on their role |
| **OTP** | One-Time Password — a temporary code sent to your email to verify it's really you |

## ❓ Quick FAQ

**Q: Do I need a GPU to run this?**
A local LLM (Qwen) works best with a GPU, which is why the project is designed to run on Google Colab. It can fall back to a smaller model or CPU mode if no GPU is available, though responses will be slower.

**Q: Is the data real?**
No — ports, shipments, carriers, and customer data are generated for demo purposes. Only the live weather data (from Open-Meteo) is real-time.

**Q: Can the AI Copilot make up numbers?**
It's designed not to. The Copilot is instructed to answer only from data it can retrieve (the database or uploaded PDFs) and to say so clearly when it doesn't have enough information.

**Q: What happens if the 3B model can't load?**
The app automatically falls back to the smaller Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model so the Copilot keeps working, just with slightly less detailed responses.

**Q: Why does the README talk about "Milestones" — do I need to run them separately?**
No. Milestones 1–3 were development stages; everything they built is already merged into the single Milestone 4 application described in this README. You only need to run the current app.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Future Scope

### Current Limitations
- Uses generated/synthetic data for most modules rather than live commercial freight data.
- SQLite is used for simplicity, which limits how many people can use the app at the same time.
- Designed as a single-organization demo rather than a multi-company production system.

### Possible Future Improvements
- Connect to real freight-rate and carrier APIs instead of demo data.
- Move to a more scalable database for multiple concurrent users.
- Add more languages and refine translation accuracy for maritime-specific terms.
- Expand the RAG knowledge base to update automatically from a shared document folder.
